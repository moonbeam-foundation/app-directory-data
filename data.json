With Uniswap, LPs earn 0.3% of trading fees whereas on Sushiswap, LPs will earn 0.25% fees, with the remaining 0.05% being distributed to SUSHI holders.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to incentivize early liquidity providers with added incentive for bootstrapping the pools. In Uniswap, LPs earn fees so long as liquidity is provided. Sushiswap aims to add a more passive form of income with early LPs benefitting from the future traction of the protocol through SUSHI and the 0.05% fee.\r\n\r\nIn typical DeFi degen style, SushiSwap founder Chef Nomi made a call to arms for auditors to conduct a smart contract audit after the protocol reached $150M in TVL within the first 5 hours of launch. Quantstamp has since taken responsibility to audit the contracts alongside a 48 hour time lock on the governance contract to prevent any malicious activity from the founder. A rewards distribution of 10% has been set aside for the team for audits & operational expenses, an allocation which can reportedly be adjusted through governance.",

    "description": "WePiggy is an open source, non-custodial crypto asset lending market protocol. In Wepiggy’s market, users can deposit their crypto assets to earn interest, or borrow others by paying interests.\r\n\r\nCompared with pioneers such as Compound and Aave, WePiggy wishes to create more markets for user’s choices; optimize the execution efficiency of smart contracts, low-down the gas cost; equip users with more financial tools, not only flash loan, but also margin, options, etc. Of course, all the improvements are premised on the basis of users’ fund safety.\r\n\r\nAlso, WePiggy will try the best to bring better user experience to users. Especially in East Asia market, more improvements would be made to lower the learning barrier for users. With the gradual improvement of the protocol, WePiggy may build up a series of dApps for users here.\r\nIn WePiggy’s governance, the core team would like to take a more positive and responsible role. We believe in the importance of goals and fundamental principles, and we fully understand that high quality governance won’t happen in a soulless project.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at the early stage of WePiggy’s governance, the core team will actively participate in the governance to work with the community to form an atmosphere of scientific governance. We will discuss the basic governance framework of WePiggy Protocol with all members of the community in our first proposal after the governance forum goes live.",

The Captain and his crew worked tirelessly to keep the ship afloat. Badly damaged, the Ship limped to the edges of the storm. It was taking on water and the cries of terrified children could be heard above the crashing waves. Another ship appeared on the horizon, it’s light glowing brightly against the dark night. The Captain of the Fortune’s Grasp ordered his crew to evacuate the families, but the fifty crew members ignored the Captain, abandoning ship, taking all means of escape with them. The Captain, left on the sinking ship, cursed the cowardly crew for damning those innocent souls to the watery depths. Those Forsaken Fifty were marked with The Black Spot, doomed to row the high seas until the Reaper came to claim his mutinous crew to serve on the Ship Of The Damned. However, if they could convince another soul to take their place at the oars, protection would be offered by those Pirates who’ve cheated the Reaper before. Those who’ve served and survived are welcome in the Damned Pirates Society.\r\n\r\nThe Damned Pirate Society is an Profile Picture NFT with inbuilt utility.

    "description": "PawnFi is a crowd-appraising and multi-lateral liquidity protocol for Non-Standard-Assets, a brand new lending and leasing market to provide fair appraisal, liquidity and use case for Non-Standard Assets (NSA).\r\n\r\nIt prioritizes support to ETH, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum and Moonbeam in Pawnfi EVM version, and has integrated multi-chain versions in the same front end, so that assets will not be fragmented and user experience will be improved on Pawnfi's multi-chain versions.\r\n\r\nIt is the first DeFi product which introduces the pawn concept, also a brand-new lending and leasing market to provide fair appraisal, liquidity and use case for Non-Standard Assets (NSA). Besides supporting mainstream assets, Pawnfi covers all types of NSA including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens), tokenized rights, and minor cryptocurrencies with relatively less liquidity. Pawnfi has achieved the divestiture of asset ownership, use rights, and earning rights within the product in an innovative way, so that asset holders and users can maximize capital efficiency. Compared with other lending protocols in the industry, Pawnfi can provide a wider range of asset support, a more flexible loan portfolio, and more diversified asset realization solutions.\r\n\r\nThe typical features of NSA include their scarcity and their attributes as an investment or collection. However, its nature determines that it is not smooth for trading, and many NSAs are embedded with unique utility (like gaming assets or computing power). Therefore, we believe that the best way to unleash the value of NSA is to empower them with broader use case of collateralized loan and leasing, so that NSA holders can obtain cash flow without losing their ownership.\r\n\r\nThus, Pawnfi showed up. With co-existing pawn/ lease/ sale and many other innovative functions, asset holders can easily combine each other to maximize the utility of their assets.",

By accommodating multiple chains and various sets of mnemonics, and ensuring compatibility with other wallets in terms of mnemonics and addresses, FoxWallet aims to empower users in conveniently managing multiple accounts with a single set of seed phrases while keeping every address independent of each other.\nAs a decentralized wallet, the mnemonics and private keys of users are stored locally with the help of distributed individual nodes, instead of being uploaded to a centralized server. FoxWallet essentially wants to empower users to be in control of their own private keys and seed phrases, further lowering the risk of theft and censorship. \n\nUtilities Offered by FoxWallet\nFoxWallet offers a wide range of Web3 tools and features like cloud mining/staking, purchasing crypto with fiat currency, interacting with dapps across multiple ecosystems. They also provide a simplified DID registration service for a better user experience.

It is a decentralized interoperability fabric that connects blockchain ecosystems, applications and users.\r\n\r\nIt developed by the founding team members of Algorand, and their team, is powered by a decentralized network and designed explicitly to frictionlessly connect all blockchain ecosystems that speak different languages. Axelar fabric connects stand alone blockchains, such as the Bitcoin Network and Ethereum, and cross-chain hubs, such as Cosmos or Polkadot, to enable developers to operate using a universal protocol and API. This will save dApp developers from rewriting their applications as new bridges are developed. Axelar is powered by a decentralized open network of validators that collectively run a byzantine consensus protocol, meaning that the system will continue to run even where some of the nodes may act maliciously or fail.",

Nomad features many of the features we prize in an optimistic mechanism, like public verification, low gas fees, broad participation, but has a slightly different security model.\r\n\r\nNomad will form the base layer of a cross-chain communication network that provides fast, cheap communication for all smart contract chains and rollups. It relies only on widely-available cryptographic primitives (unlike header relays), has a latency of a few hours (rather than an ORU’s one week latency), and imposes only about 120,000 gas overhead on message senders.\r\n\r\nNomad has been designed for ease of implementation in any blockchain that supports user-defined computations. We will provide initial Solidity implementations of the on-chain contracts, and Rust implementations of the off-chain system agents.\r\n\r\nNomad is an implementation and extension of the Optics protocol (OPTimistic Interchain Communication).",

By providing smart contracts secure access to these key resources, ChainLink allows them to mimic real world agreements that require external proof of performance and need to make payment in widely available payment methods e.g. bank payments.\r\n\r\nThe Chainlink Network is a decentralized network of ChainLink Nodes, which are all selling usage of specific data feeds, APIs and various off-chain payment capabilities directly to a smart contract. Any data, payments, e-signature, or other API provider, as well as individual developers, can easily join the network by connecting an API they're familiar with. Once the API they'd like to offer to smart contracts is connected to a ChainLink, they become a ChainLink Node Operator, responsible for keeping that API connected to the ChainLink Network and being compensated in LINK for their successful fulfillment of on-chain requests.",

However, Polkadot’s success depends on a strong, healthy and lively ecosystem to gain significance. To help foster building out the Polkadot Ecosystem, on the one hand, projects within the Polkaverse will need significant funding due to long runways. On the other hand, DOT holders who already invested into the project need a mechanism to re-invest their now transferable assets into promising projects.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could enable DOT holders to re-invest their DOT tokens into the Polkadot ecosystem to fund projects (prospective parachains, application builders, etc.) and earn return on their investments in a sustainable and secure way?\r\n\r\nWe propose the Polkadot Liquidity Mechanism (Polimec), which is an open-source blockchain system designed to help getting liquidity into Polkadot based projects that are not yet ready to sell transferable currencies on their own technology. It is a concept like the ERC20 Smart Contract mechanism but for issuing pre-Currencies on Polkadot or Kusama as it enables Polkaverse projects to issue transferable pre-coins before go-live of their main net.",
