  "description": "Colb is the first native non-custodial tokenization solution that enables peerless access to Swiss-grade wealth management strategies, pre-IPO opportunities, and premium investment funds. It offers a bankruptcy remote Trust structure and native ownership of real-world assets, all on-chain. Colb reduces the entrance threshold to such investments by removing constraints such as the minimum investment amount to get exposure to them. The protocol is designed with security at its core, boasting compliance with Swiss regulations and DeFi composability. Colb envisions a future rooted in transparency where every individual has equitable access to premium RWA investments.",
