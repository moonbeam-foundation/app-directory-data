  "description": "Zoombies is an infinite world of NFT collectible trading cards built on Rarity, Scarcity and Community.\n\nThe Zoombies World brings all the value and excitement of blockchain NFTs into a tidy free-to-play mix of predictable rules that result in unpredictable outcomes. Zoombies has something for everyone, and when luck strikes, it can take you out of this world! Zoombies is a full cycle token economy which allows players to mint, trade and burn NFTs alongside the ZOOM ERC-20 standard token for highly liquid value transfer.",
