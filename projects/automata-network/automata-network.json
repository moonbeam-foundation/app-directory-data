  "description": "Automata Network is a decentralized service protocol that provides a privacy middleware layer for dApps across multiple blockchains.\r\n\r\nWitness is an off-chain governance platform that provides a simple interface for users to create governance proposals and vote on them while maintaining their anonymity by choosing between various privacy levels. The actual voting is conducted off-chain to eliminate gas costs and encourage greater participation in the governance process. On-chain execution is also possible via Chainhook, as the contract registered during proposal creation can be triggered based on the final voting results.",
