  "shortDescription": "Unlocking the True Potential of Decentralized Finance",
  "description": "UniLend is a permission-less decentralized protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts.\n\nThe existing DeFi platforms act as a gatekeeper in allowing which projects to be a part of the their pool; thereby barring the majority of assets from participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Multi-asset pools also expose lenders to risk associated with all of the included assets with no control over the collaterals against which their funds can be lent.",
