  "shortDescription": "The First Multichain NFT Monster Hunt",
  "description": "Blockchain Monster Hunt (BCMH) is the world’s first multi-chain game that runs entirely on the blockchain itself. Inspired by Pokémon-GO,BCMH allows players  to continuously explore brand new places on the blockchain to hunt and battle monsters. Each block on the blockchain is a unique digital space where a limited number of monsters (of the same DNA gene and rarity) may exist.  Players and collectors can hunt or battle for a chance to capture these unique monsters and to earn coins.",
