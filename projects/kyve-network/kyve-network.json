  "description": "KYVE Network, Archiving the web on Arweave, Decentralised archivers and validators. KYVE is an initiative to store any data stream, with built-in validation. By leveraging the Arweave blockchain, we can permanently and immutably store this data.\r\n\r\nThe network is powered by decentralised archivers and validators. These nodes reside in pools, each pool focusing on archiving a specific data stream. Pools are funded by $KYVE tokens, and anyone can fund these storage initiatives by depositing tokens.\r\n\r\nA designated archiver is appointed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation) for each pool. Nodes are incentivised by a unique staking system, which involves them locking their $KYVE tokens while being active in the pool.\r\n\r\nValidators will \"get together\" and vote on whether the designated archiver is properly doing it's job. If the validators come to a consensus that the archiver is no longer acting honestly or reliably, a new archiver will be decided upon in the DAO. Validators can seemlessly transition into an archiver if need be.",
