  "description": "The Graph is a protocol for building decentralized applications quickly on Ethereum and IPFS using GraphQL.\r\n\r\nWe're building The Graph because we've seen the challenges in getting data off blockchains. We envision The Graph as a truly decentralized ecosystem where the community can collaborate on curating quality data sources available to all. Together we can build a new generation of the web free from data silos and monopolies.",
