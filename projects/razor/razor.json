  "shortDescription": "Truly decentralized oracle network for decentralized world",
  "description": "Razor Network is a decentralized oracle providing data to the smart contracts using a network of stakers. Razor network is fast, robust and offers a high degree of economic security due to its full scale decentralization. The continually evolving platform is fully prepared to swiftly and smartly handle any unforeseen incidents.\r\n\r\nIt connects smart contracts with data in fast and secure way. Smart contracts do not have access to external data. Such data is necessary for operation of various decentralized applications.\r\n\r\nTraditionally this is done by using a centralized servers called “Oracles”. But they are a single point of failure in otherwise decentralized applications and must be trustworthy.",
