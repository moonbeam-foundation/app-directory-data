The investment strategy tied to the specific vault will automatically increase your deposited token amount by compounding arbitrary yield farm reward tokens back into your initially deposited asset. Despite what the name ‘Vault’ suggests, your funds are never locked in any vault on Beefy Finance: you can always withdraw at any moment in time.",
