  "shortDescription": "Automate your\nsmart contracts",
  "description": "Using Gelato Ops, developers can input the contract address and function they want to automate, when they want to automate it, and how they will pay for it. Having submitted this information as a “task”, it will be picked up by Gelato Executors and executed at the right time. Developers can monitor past transactions, manage their budget, and debug their tasks. Payments can be in the network token (ETH, MATIC, or FTM) and soon with other tokens, including DAI or USDC.",
