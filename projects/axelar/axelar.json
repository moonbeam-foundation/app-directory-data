  "shortDescription": "Connecting dapps with  Blockchain Ecosystem",
  "description": "AXELAR, Making cross-chain communication as simple as using http/https. It is a decentralized interoperability fabric that connects blockchain ecosystems, applications and users.\r\n\r\nIt developed by the founding team members of Algorand, and their team, is powered by a decentralized network and designed explicitly to frictionlessly connect all blockchain ecosystems that speak different languages. Axelar fabric connects stand alone blockchains, such as the Bitcoin Network and Ethereum, and cross-chain hubs, such as Cosmos or Polkadot, to enable developers to operate using a universal protocol and API. This will save dApp developers from rewriting their applications as new bridges are developed. Axelar is powered by a decentralized open network of validators that collectively run a byzantine consensus protocol, meaning that the system will continue to run even where some of the nodes may act maliciously or fail.",
